### Data Storage

We use **MongoDB**, a flexible NoSQL database, to store posts and comments as JSON-like documents. Its schema-less design allows easy updates and efficient retrieval of posts with their comments, making it ideal for this service.


### üß© Architecture
- Next.js frontend consumes backend REST APIs
- Backend stores posts, comments, likes in DB
- Markdown-powered comments with live updates
- Nginx as reverse proxy in production
